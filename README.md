# Guessing Number Game

This is a simple Python game where the computer picks a random number and the player tries to guess it.

The program gives hints:
- **Go Higher** → Your guess is too low
- **Go Lower** → Your guess is too high
- **Correct** → You guessed the right number

The game also counts how many attempts it took to guess correctly.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The game chooses a random number (e.g., between 1 to 10 or 1 to 1000).
2. You enter your guess.
3. The game will tell you:
   - `"Go Higher"` if your guess is smaller
   - `"Go Lower"` if your guess is bigger
4. Keep guessing until you find the exact number.
5. The game shows how many attempts you took.
